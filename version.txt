January 9th, 2013 - version 0.5
	First attempt to get a code for simulation of the first benchmarck article case.
	A plane source emitting 0,521 MeV electrons towards a beryllium phantom.

January 8th, 2013 - version 0.4
	Simulation of an isotropic 6 MeV electron source 100 cm far 
	from the water phantom surface. Phanton is made of several 1 mm tick slices. 
	1 million event has been simulated for each point.

August 30th, 2012  - version 0.2
	Today is the beginning of some learning and refactoring.

August 30th, 2012 - version 0.1
	This is the 0.1 version used for a simulation test.
	The result of this simulation is in the folder "results".
	This project needs tons of refactoring and documentation.
