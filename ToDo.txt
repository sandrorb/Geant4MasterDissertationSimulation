August 23, 2012: This file is for remind me about things that must be done in this project.


List of things that must be done:

	* ATTENTION: the point source code must be checked!!!!
	* It is necessary to understand better about Sensitive Detector and how to accumulate
	  information like radiation dose.
	* Simple simulation of a water tank irradiated by electons.
	* Simple simulation of a water tank irradiated by photons.
