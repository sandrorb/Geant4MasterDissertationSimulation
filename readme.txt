This C++ project (which uses GEANT4.9.3.p02 Toolkit from CERN)
has been designed and implemented by Sandro Boschetti. This project
is part of my master's dissertation at PCTN/UFMG (http://nuclear.ufmg.br).

Geant4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles 
through matter: http://geant4.cern.ch
