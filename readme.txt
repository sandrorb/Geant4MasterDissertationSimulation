This ONGOING C++ project, which uses GEANT4.9.3.p02 Toolkit from CERN,
has been designed and implemented by Sandro Boschetti. This project
is part of my master's dissertation at PCTN/UFMG - http://nuclear.ufmg.br.

Geant4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles 
through matter - http://geant4.cern.ch.
